# Mini-course: Python & Deep Learning

This repository contains a small **Python & Deep Learning refresher course** that I am building while revisiting these topics myself 🙂  
The idea is to learn and structure the material at the same time.

The course will probably consist of about **four lessons**.  
The first one is a **Python and Jupyter Notebook refresher**, written in **French**, to get started with the tools before moving on to deeper machine-learning topics.

## Course structure

| Lesson | Topic |
|--------|-------|
| Lesson 1 | Python & Jupyter Refresher (in French) |
| Lesson 2 | Multilayer Perceptron from scratch |
| Lesson 3 | ?? |
| Lesson 4 | ?? |

Notebooks are located in the `notebooks/` directory.

## Run on Google Colab

Lesson 1:
